# Runequest Glorantha Character Sheet

At the top of each version of the sheet is a settings cog if this is clicked there are check  boxes to select which version of the sheet to display.  This will allow for selection of the sheet displayed if for some reason this settings in the Gamer Detaild fail.

## Quick Start

This is for the Qucik Start only the category modifiers arenot calculated and is intended only for one shots to demo the new system

One thing to note is the way the damage per location works.  Instead of just knocking  points down as damage is taken there is a damage box so you can put in wounds as they are taken so that you can apply first aid separately.  So if you take a 2 wound and then a 4 point the damage box  should look like 2+4. Make sure there is no trailing + signs, so don't have it look like 3+5+ .  There is a separate box in the hit point section for damage to total hit points such as bleeding and poison. 

Make sure the STR and DEX minimums are entered for weapons as you could end up with large penalties to attack if you do not.

In the animals section make sure you include the damage bonus for the animals 1d6+3d6.  A default bonus is calculated in the stats section but the damage bonus can vary depening on the weapon.  It could be full no damage bonus/full damage bonus/half damge or even just damage bonus.

Make sure you put the full mp cost for a variable spell in the mp column so that Free INT can be calculated.
